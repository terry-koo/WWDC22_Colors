My application was created with SwiftUI, and it's designed for young children who want to be familiar with colors, people who want to know what colors can be combined to produce a particular color, and users who develop a sense of color.

## Tech
- [SwiftUI] - Advanced app experiences and tools


## Supported Devices 
- iPad Pro (9.7-inch) 
- iPad Pro (11-inch)
- iPad Pro (12.9-inch)


## Features
- Landscape mode only
- Dark / Light mode is available
- Swiftplayground is also supported when running in landscape mode

In the upper right corner of the main page of the app, the complementary color scheme has been shown to help users get used to it.
Also, intuitively, what colors combine to produce the resulting colors, and the triangles and triangles are combined to make them visually conspicuous using pentagon.

For example, a triangle is composed of three primary colors, and the isosceles attached to the hypotenuse of the triangle represent colors that can come from the combination of primary colors that are tangent to the quadratic color.
